# Sankey Diagram of applicant journeys through PtC funding programmes

## Interpretation

The above Sankey diagram plots the journeys of the 3,452 applicants to one or more of the four funding programmes: Booster, Bright Ideas, Community Business Fund, and Trade Up. The plot communicates the following information:
1. The application order is on the horizontal (x) axis i.e. first application, second application, third application, fourth application. We ignore organisations that submitted 5, 6 or 7 applications for presentation reasons (n = 17).
2. The vertical bars capture the programme and funding outcome e.g. Bright Ideas and Not funded; think of this as a **classification of applicant type**. Hovering the cursor over a vertical bar reveals the following measures:
    * *total number of organisations* captured by a vertical bar.
    * *incoming flow count* - the number of types of applicant who flow into this vertical bar. For example, five different types of applicant make up the 86 applicants who apply to Bright Ideas with their second application and are not funded. 
    * *outgoing flow count* - the number of types of applicant who flow out of this vertical bar. For example, the 86 applicants who apply to Bright Ideas with their second application and are not funded, end up in six different vertical bars with their third application.
3. The lines between vertical bars capture:
    * *the source* of that flow.
    * *the target* of that flow.
    * *total number of organisations* moving between the vertical bars.
